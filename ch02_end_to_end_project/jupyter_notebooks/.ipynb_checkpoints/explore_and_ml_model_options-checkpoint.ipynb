    "The chapter assumes working for a company that needs to implement a machine learning model to ingest California housing data\n",
    "from the 1990's, learn and make accurate median housing prices for new and future instances, instances being district units defined by the U.S. Census Data. Once this system is ready to evaluate new data and predict new median housing prices, it will be part of a larger pipeline system, in which it's output will be used to decide if it is worth investing in new districts and regions based on the predicted median housing prices."
